# Bug Reports

If you have the chance, before reporting a bug, please [search existing
issues](https://github.com/linuxaged/m3d/search?q=&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93),
as it's possible that someone else has already reported your error. This doesn't
always work, and sometimes it's hard to know what to search for, so consider this
extra credit. We won't mind if you accidentally file a duplicate report.

Opening an issue is as easy as following [this
link](https://github.com/linuxaged/m3d/issues/new) and filling out the fields.
